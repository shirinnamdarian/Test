1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:03,560
This is Charlie, a Defence Employee

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:05,400
Let’s see Charlie’s attitude towards

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,480
security in this scenario

4
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:09,480
It’s Monday morning and Charlie is

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:12,240
finishing his breakfast. On the Radio

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,720
that morning there’s a breaking news

7
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:15,640
story on an incident affecting Defence

8
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,920
capability and information

9
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,520
due to suspected cyber activity

10
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:22,960
Charlie doesn’t pay particular

11
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,720
attention to the news, he’s getting

12
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,000
ready for a busy day, when he’s done

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,920
he rushes out the door

14
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,320
Driving to work Charlie hears

15
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,720
the breaking news story again

16
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:35,200
The story talks about a website

17
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,800
exposing classified Defence

18
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,680
information related to millions of

19
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:40,800
dollars of high tech equipment

20
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,120
Still not paying much attention

21
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,560
to the story, Charlie changes channel

22
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,080
to listen to some music

23
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,760
When Charlie arrives at work his

24
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,600
workmates are talking about the leak

25
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,600
It was apparently hacked from someone’s

26
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,240
personal email account. They’re

27
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,960
wondering who in their right mind would

28
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,120
send classified information from the

29
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,720
DPN to their home email account?

30
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:04,200
Charlie remembers he sent classified

31
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,480
information to his Gmail last Friday

32
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,400
because he wanted to save time

33
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,520
to meet project deadlines

34
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,760
Charlie’s workmates explain how he has

35
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,800
compromised the information, risked

36
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,520
Defence’s reputation and put the

37
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,520
entire project at risk

38
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,640
Charlie explains he was just trying

39
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,880
to be efficient and meet the deadline

40
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,120
Charlie is informed that senior

41
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,680
management have been in the boardroom

42
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,680
all morning discussing the

43
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,200
Security incident

44
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,520
Charlie becomes greatly concerned

45
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,160
He thinks about how this could affect

46
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:38,000
him. Will he lose his job, what could

47
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,560
this mean for his family? He didn’t

48
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,240
mean to cause Defence’s

49
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,800
reputation harm

50
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:47,080
The boardroom door opens and Charlie

51
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:49,120
is immediately requested to come in

52
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,640
Charlie’s actions weren’t unintentional

53
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,560
they were deliberate

54
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,560
If he listened to his Security Officer

55
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,800
about protecting Official Information

56
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,160
or paid attention when completing his

57
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,400
Annual Security Awareness Course he

58
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,200
would have understood exactly

59
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,320
what could happen to him
